# TinderBot
Automating my love life.

### Overview (v1)
A stupidly simple bot written in Python that uses Selenium to automate the process of logging into Tinder and swiping right on Tinder profiles. 
Current version lacks advanced swiping strategy and messaging features; more to come in future versions.

### Running the Bot
1. Before running the bot, make sure you enter your Gmail and Facebook login information into `login_info.py`
2. Ensure you have the Selenium installed using `pip`:
   `pip install selenium` 
3. Make sure to download ChromeDriver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
4. Run the following command: `python bot.py`
